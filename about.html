    <div id= "basic"> <p>  So I am 15 years old and I go to Envision Aacademy in Downtown Oakland. I am going to the 10th grade. Im single, yes its true, and Im
             ready to mingle but I need someone to get on my level. PERIOD POOH. Right now I am doing smash and I am enjoying it. I think that SMASH is
              a really good oppurtunity to get ahead in life. Its exciting but still tiring. I was born on March 11, 2004 in Los Angeles, California</p></div>
