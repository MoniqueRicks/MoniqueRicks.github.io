      For college I want to first get a full ride scholarship for track and feild or at least a partial scholarship.
      I have been really looking into <strong> HBCUs </strong> (<em>Historaclly Black Colleges</em>) for college options.
      More specifically i have been looking at North Carolina A&T and maybe Howard University. What I look for in colleges
      is a good track program and good academics. I plan to work hard to get good grades and do well in track. For what i want
      to do in college is i want to Do some kind of law or biology and african american studies. I think its really important to
      have multiple options and ideas for topics and i leanred that from Morgan from the networking night. I specifically
      want to study to be a civil rights attorney or to work in sports medicine.

    would be to be a kinesiologist (sports medicine) or a civil right attorney.
